## What?

Cure is a library for Dart developers which contains some useful tools and extensions: Signalr, MessagePack, CRC, HTTP, EventSource, WebSocket, etc.

## Why?

Dart is a beautiful language which is used by Flutter framework. But some tools such as Signalr, CRC was not supported by native, and there's some API only work in Web or DartVM, so I create this library to solve these problems.

## How?

Talk is cheap. Show me the [code](example/README.md):)
